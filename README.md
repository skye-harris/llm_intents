# Tools for Assist _(Custom Integration for Home Assistant)_

Additional tools for LLM-backed Assist for Home Assistant:

* **Web Search** powered by your choice of _Brave_ or _SearXNG_
* **Location Search** powered by Google Places
* **Wikipedia**
* **Weather Forecast**
* **YouTube Search and Playback**
* **Basic Utilities** — Calculator, Kitchen Unit Converter, and Date Information

Each tool is optional and configurable via the integrations UI. Some tools require API keys, but are usable on free tiers.
A caching layer is utilised in order to reduce both API usage and latency on repeated requests for the same information within a 2-hour period.

### ⛅ Weather Forecast

Rather than accessing the internet directly for weather information, this tool utilises your existing Home Assistant weather integration and makes the forecast data accessible to your LLM in an intelligent manner.

At a minimum, this tool requires a weather entity that provides either daily or twice-daily forecast data.
It is recommended, though optional, to also specify a weather entity that provides hourly weather data.

For cases where a specific days weather is requested (eg: `today`, `tomorrow`, `wednesday`), the hourly data will be provided if available.
If data for the week is requested, no hourly forecast entity is set, or the hourly forecast does not contain data for the requested day, the daily weather data will be used instead.

#### Requirements

* An existing weather forecast integration configured within Home Assistant.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Select "Weather Forecast" during setup.
2. Select the weather entity that provides daily forecast information.
3. Optionally, select the weather entity that provides hourly forecast information.
4. Optionally, select a local temperature sensor entity to display current temperature for today's hourly forecast.

### Options

| Setting                      | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Daily Weather Entity`       | ✅        | The weather entity to use for daily weather forecast data                                                   |
| `Hourly Weather Entity`      | ❌        | The weather entity to use for hourly weather forecast data                                                  |
| `Current Temperature Sensor` | ❌        | Optional local sensor entity to provide current temperature when requesting today's hourly weather forecast |

### 🎥 YouTube Search + Playback

Searches YouTube for videos and enables playback on compatible media players. The tool combines YouTube search capabilities with intelligent media player detection to provide a seamless video playback experience.

Search results include video titles, URLs, channel names, descriptions, and publication dates. When a user requests to play a video, the search results are automatically used with the playback tool to start video on the appropriate device.

#### Requirements

* Requires a [Google API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) with the **YouTube Data API v3** enabled.
* The same Google API key can be shared with the Google Places tool if both are configured.
* Google provides a free tier with generous quotas for YouTube Data API v3.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Select "YouTube" during setup.
2. Enter your Google API key (the same key used for Google Places if configured).
3. Configure the number of search results to return (default: 1).

#### Playback Compatibility

The YouTube tool works seamlessly with Home Assistant media players that support video playback. Video-capable devices are automatically detected based on their `device_class` attribute:

**Supported Device Classes:**

* `tv` - Television devices (e.g., smart TVs, Android TV boxes)
* `receiver` - AV receivers with video output

**Not Supported:**

* `speaker` - Audio-only devices are automatically excluded
* Media players without a `device_class` set - These must be explicitly configured

**Playback Targeting:**
Videos can be played by specifying:

* **Entity ID** - Direct entity selection (e.g., `media_player.living_room_tv`)
* **Area** - Play on all video-capable devices in an area (e.g., "Living Room")
* **Device ID** - Target a specific device by its device registry ID

The tool automatically filters media players to only include video-capable devices when using area-based targeting, ensuring videos are only sent to devices that can display them.

#### How It Works

1. **Search**: When a user requests a YouTube video, the `search_youtube` tool queries YouTube's API and returns matching videos with metadata.
2. **Playback**: If the user wants to play a video, the `play_video` tool uses the video URL from search results and calls Home Assistant's `media_player.play_media` service on the target device(s).
3. **Caching**: Search results are cached for 2 hours to reduce API usage and improve response times for repeated queries.

#### Options

| Setting             | Required | Default | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `API Key`           | ✅        | —       | Google API key with YouTube Data API v3 enabled                          |
| `Number of Results` | ✅        | `1`     | Number of video results to return (1-25). Use more for multiple options. |
